# AI Trading Bot for RWA Tokens XDC Decentralised Exchange🤖

Welcome to the **AI Trading Bot Platform**, a fully autonomous trading system designed to trade **Real World Asset (RWA)** tokens on the **XDC Network's decentralised exchange (DEX)**. This AI-powered bot leverages market sentiment, data analytics, and a **multi-agent architecture** to manage portfolios, execute trades, and maximise returns with minimal human intervention.

- Analyses market trends and real-time data
- Executes smart trades on XDC’s DEX
- Optimises user portfolios for returns and risk
- Monitors sentiment from financial news, forums, and social media
